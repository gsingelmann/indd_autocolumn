# Auto Column

## How to use

Place the cursor inside a table and start the script.

## What it does

InDesign allows you to set the width of a table one column at a time. There is no option to keep the overall width of the table the same when changing a single column.

This script opens a dialog to control all column widths in one go.

## The UI

From top to bottom:

#### 1, 2, 3, 4 ...

The number/index of the column. When you open the script for a table with many columns you will get a verrrry wide dialog.

#### 27.5, 40, 27.5 ...

The column widths before calling the script.

#### The input-fields

The new width for each column.

#### ☑︎ auto

One idea of the script is not change the overall width of the table. To achieve that you can set some columns to "auto". After adding up all non-auto-values the remainig table width is automatically distributed over the auto-values.

#### All Auto on/off

Sets or unsets all auto-checkboxes.

#### "Load from style" and "Store..."

Set the checkbox to store your widths inside the table-style assigned to the current table on clicking "OK".

That allows you to retrieve the widths in another table of the same style.

### Update 21-02-08

The width is now taken from the width of the textcolumn instead of the width of the textframe boundaries.

As a side effect the script now should handle rotated textframes as well.

## Installation

### Basic Installation

1. Open the Scripting Panel

2. Right-click the entry "User" and select "Reveal in Finder".

3. Place script in folder "Scripts Panel"

### Startup Scripts

Some scripts are declared as "Startup Scripts". These are scripts that are automatically run, right after InDesign starts.

For those simply create a folder with the name "Startup Scripts" right beside the "Scripts Panel" folder and place the script inside.

### Storing scripts somewhere else

The "Scripts Panel" folder is located in preferences folder of your current InDesign-Version.

I have installed several versions of InDesign (since the customer and his version is "always right" ;) ) but I want to have a single installation folder that is shared among the InDesign-versions.

It used to be that an alias was good enough for this purpose but that changed a few years ago. Now you need something that is called a [symbolic link](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/115646/how-can-i-create-a-symbolic-link-in-terminal).

1. Find the Terminal in Application:Utilities:
1. Open the folder that contains the folder where you want to store your scripts
1. Drag the folder-symbol in the window bar onto the Terminal

![open folder in terminal](https://www.cuppascript.com/stuff/readme_pix/install/04-open-terminal.jpg)

By dragging the folder onto the terminal that folder is automatically set as 'current folder' so you don’t have to bother about paths.

4. Now type `ln -s nameofsourcefolder nameofsymboliclink`

In my example:

``` bash
ln -s my\ real\ scripts\ folder/ my-scripts
```

5. Drag the link (here: `my-scripts`) into your "Scripts Panel" folder

### Folder Structure

Instead of simply putting all your scripts flat into the Scripts Panel you can create a folder structure.

![folders](https://www.cuppascript.com/stuff/readme_pix/install/06-structure.jpg)

The Scripts panel will show the same structure:
